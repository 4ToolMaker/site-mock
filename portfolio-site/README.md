# Build A Portfolio Site

## Purpose

This is a project for the Udacity Full Stack Nanodegree.

The aim was to create a basic portfolio and to make it responsive. In order to make it responsive or dynamic various technologies were implemented.

Therefore, I decided to use bootstrap and font-awesome to name just a few.

Thank you!
